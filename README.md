## Current Labs

### 1. TryHackMe: Phishing Email Analysis & Triage
**Completed:** January 2026  
**Focus:** SOC L1 alert triage and phishing detection

**Scenario:** Investigated four phishing-related security alerts in a simulated SOC environment, demonstrating alert queue management, threat classification, and incident response decision-making.

**Key Outcomes:**
- ✅ Achieved 75% true positive identification rate (3/4 alerts)
- ✅ Correlated multiple alerts to identify coordinated phishing campaign
- ✅ Applied MITRE ATT&CK framework to map attacker techniques
- ✅ Utilized Splunk for log correlation and TryDetectThis for threat intelligence
- ✅ Properly escalated incidents and documented findings for L2 analysts

**Skills Applied:**
- Alert triage and prioritization
- URL and IP reputation analysis
- Domain spoofing and typosquatting detection
- SIEM querying (Splunk)
- Playbook adherence
- Incident documentation
- Threat intelligence integration

## Real-World Application

While these are training labs, the skills directly apply to my current role as a Desktop Engineer supporting enterprise security operations:

**Professional Security Experience:**
- Partner with external SOC teams for CrowdStrike Falcon alert triage
- Investigate endpoint security alerts and execute remediation
- Deploy critical security patches via SCCM to 3,000+ endpoints
- Support phishing simulation campaigns and security awareness training
- Maintain HIPAA compliance through endpoint hardening and policy enforcement

These labs enhance my ability to transition from infrastructure security support into a dedicated SOC Analyst role.
